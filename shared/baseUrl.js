export const baseUrl = 'http://192.168.1.210:3001/';
//will be able to use baseUrl constant whenever neeed to use url code rather than change everywhere in code
//be aware that ip address can and most likely will change if you connect to a different network
//if you disconnect and reconnect later, this can also change the ip address
//check this first if you are having issues later
